# Angular Training

This branch includes a cleaned up version of the standard Angular project generated by `ng new`,
which we'll use as the basis for our entire training.

## Getting and displaying data

Generally speaking, Angular applications are made up of _components_ and _services_; 
components are about presenting data and interacting with the user, 
while services incorporate the application's business logic, including obtaining 
data from some external source and processing it.

We want now to retrieve some data to display, so we'll query a public API returning
a list of registered on GitHub: `https://api.github.com/organizations?per_page={limit}`.
In Angular, one creates a service for that; we will then _inject_ that service 
where it's required.

## The GitHub organizations service
 
Run the following command from the command line:
```text
ng generate service GitHubOrganizations
```
It will generate class `GitHubOrganizationsService` in 
_src/app/git-hub-organizations.service.ts_ and its test counterpart, 
_src/app/git-hub-organizations.service.specs.ts_. 

We edit git-hub-organizations.service.ts:
```typescript
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GitHubOrganizationsService {

    constructor( private httpClient: HttpClient ) {
    }

    fetchOrganizations( count: number ): void {
        const url = 'https://api.github.com/organizations?per_page=' + count;
        this.httpClient.get( url )
            .toPromise()
            .then(  data  => console.log(   JSON.stringify( data  )))
            .catch( error => console.error( JSON.stringify( error )));
    }
}
```
